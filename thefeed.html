					<div class="text-box">
						I use slack to stay up to date with all things relating to Delta Zeta, the sorority I've been in since freshman year. We have two separate pages, one for "business", and the other one titled, "xoxogossipturtle" is what we use on a more casual basis.

					<div class="text-box">
					
						Doing homework and staying focused is very hard for me and I've always really enjoyed listening to music while I work, but depending on what I'm doing lyrics can get very distracting for me. In the last year and a half or so I've started listening to classical music in order to keep my mind stimulated but not overwhelmed.

					<div class="text-box">
					
						After living here for almost three years I've gotten into the habit of regularly checking the weather everday before getting dressed for the day. I like being dressed and ready for whatever weather we're going to have, especially this year since I've moved off campus and it's not convienent to go back and forth to change clothes. These last few weeks have been very rainy and it reminds me a lot of home.

					<div class="text-box">

						I get about 100 emails everyday relating to school, work, travel, friends, clubs at school, promotions and so on. With so much information on my timeline everyday I check every couple of hours so I don't miss anything important.

						Recently pinterest has become one of my favorite forms of social media. I look through it for outfit inspiration, hairstyles, decor, nails, etc. In this segment I added a pin to a board one of my best friends and I share on which we're planning our apartment for next year.

					<div class="text-box">
						I don't take the bus very often, so when I do I need to use maps to make sure I get off or transfer at the right place. This day I was going from Sephora to Trader Joe's.
