		</video>
		<figcaption>I use slack to stay up to date with all things relating to Delta Zeta, the sorority I've been in since freshman year. We have two separate pages, one for "business", and the other one titled, "xoxogossipturtle" is what we use on a more casual basis. </figcaption></figure>
	<h1>Music</h1>

		</video>
		<figcaption>Doing homework and staying focused is very hard for me and I've always really enjoyed listening to music while I work, but depending on what I'm doing lyrics can get very distracting for me. In the last year and a half or so I've started listening to classical music in order to keep my mind stimulated but not overwhelmed. </figcaption>
	<h1>Weather</h1>

		</video>
		<figcaption>After living here for almost three years I've gotten into the habit of regularly checking the weather everday before getting dressed for the day. I like being dressed and ready for whatever weather we're going to have, especially this year since I've moved off campus and it's not convienent to go back and forth to change clothes. These last few weeks have been very rainy and it reminds me a lot of home.</figcaption>
	<h1>Email</h1>

			<source src="img/vid4-email.mp4" type="video/mp4">
		</video>
		<figcaption>I get about 100 emails everyday relating to school, work, travel, friends, clubs at school, promotions and so on. With so much information on my timeline everyday I check every couple of hours so I don't miss anything important. </figcaption>
	<h1>Pinterest</h1>
		<video width="300" controls>
			<source src="img/vid5-pinterest.mp4" type="video/mp4">
		</video>
		<figcaption>Recently pinterest has become one of my favorite forms of social media. I look through it for outfit inspiration, hairstyles, decor, nails, etc. In this segment I added a pin to a board one of my best friends and I share on which we're planning our apartment for next year. </figcaption>
	<h1>Canvas</h1>
		<video width="300" controls>
			<source src="img/vid6-canvas.mp4" type="video/mp4">
		</video>
		<figcaption>I strictly use my phone to upload chapter notes because I handwrite mine and then take pictures to upload, so it makes it easier to do all in one place.</figcaption>
	<h1>Bus</h1>
		<video width="300" controls>
			<source src="img/vid7-bus.mp4" type="video/mp4">
		</video>
		<figcaption>I don't take the bus very often, so when I do I need to use maps to make sure I get off or transfer at the right place. This day I was going from Sephora to Trader Joe's.</figcaption>
	<h1>Sephora</h1>

		<figcaption>One of my friends gifted me a fragrance sampler kit where you get to select one of the samples and get a free travel spray in return. In this video I selected my fragrance and headed to the store to pick it up. </figcaption>
	<h1>Apps</h1>
		<video width="300" controls>
			<source src="img/vid9-apps.mp4" type="video/mp4">

		<figcaption>I normally have about a million tabs open at a time on my phone, and these were the tabs of the day.</figcaption>
	<h1>Drive</h1>
		<video width="300" controls>
			<source src="img/vid10-drive.mp4" type="video/mp4">
		</video>
		<figcaption>I often use google drive for school work, so I created a folder for visual communication II to hold all of my work for the semester in order to stay organized.</figcaption>
	<h1>Texts</h1>
		<video width="300" controls>
			<source src="img/vid11-texts.mp4" type="video/mp4">
		</video>
		<figcaption>I text my mom almost everyday, and we were talking about the new furniture I bought from Ikea and had gotten so frustrated putting together, but once I completed it I sent her a text and later send over a video of the finished product.</figcaption>
	<h1>Alarms</h1>
		<video width="300" controls>
			<source src="img/vid12-alarms.mp4" type="video/mp4">
		</video>
		<figcaption>I always have a bunch of alarms in order to remind me of the tasks I need to complete, or else it's hard for me to remember and sometimes don't get it done.</figcaption>
